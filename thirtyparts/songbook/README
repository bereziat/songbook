chordbk, wordbk, overhead:

    These styles have been used to produce the songbooks for our church.  We
    needed to produce books that our song-leaders could use, as well as books
    for use in the congregation; so, these styles were written.

    The `chordbk' option is used to print a songbook with words and chords, and
    it also supports a `compactsong' option which lays out the song in two
    columns per page instead of one (the `wordbk' and `overhead' options do not
    support compactsong mode at present).  The `wordbk' option is used to print
    a words-only songbook.  The `overhead' option is used to print overhead
    transparencies.  They all use the same LaTeX input file.  `Wordbk' and
    `overhead' modes simply ignore all of the chord information.


songbook.dtx:

    This is both the formal documentation for the Songbook style as well as
    its source code.  A .pdf file is provided, as well as the .tex file.


sample-sb.tex:

    This is a sample songbook.  This file is used to produce the sample???.dvi
    files included with this package.  To regenerate the .dvi files, simply
    uncomment the appropriate \document line and re-LaTeX the file.
