* Description
=sng2tex= is a Perl script that produces a songbook from ascii
files. Each file describes one song using a simple format to define
chords and their positions in the lyrics. Numerous songs are available
on Internet in raw text and easily adaptable to this format.

=sng2tex= relies on LaTeX and =songs= package.

* Structure of an song file
** General structure
  A line begining by =%%= pattern will be considered
  as a comment and ignored.

  - The first line should be the song title.
  - The second line should be the author names or band name.
  - The following lines begining by =%chord= pattern produce
    a guitar chord definition. Syntax is:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
%chord Am X03320
#+END_SRC
    or
#+BEGIN_SRC 
%chord C 2:X13331
#+END_SRC
    to make appear a fret position (here 2) beside the chord.
  - The song begins after a *blank* line.
  - A line begining by =% text= pattern will display
    =text= as an annotation.
  - Other lines describe lyrics and can contain
    chord position.
** Chord position
   A chord is introduced by =[chord]= pattern, where =chord= is the
   pattern, inside the sentence. 
   - if the chord is placed just before a word: it will be placed
     just over it. 
   - put a blank between the chord and the word makes the chord
     placed over the word but after it.
   - a chord is always placed over a word. To change that, use
     =_= special character to indicate the end of group. E.g.:
     =[C]I'm the_ King=
